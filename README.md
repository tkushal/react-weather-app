[ REACT WEATHER APP ]

React App that shows weather based on users valid input for location.

1. Weather is based on users valid location input.
2. This app fetches data from an API.
3. Whenever the temperature is below 16°C the background changes to cool weather.
4. If temperature is above 16° app shows warmer background.


Note: This app makes use of weather API key, this is kept in .env file as an ACCESS_KEY. This ACCESS_KEY is accounted into our main App.js file with "process.env". So, user need to add .env file once cloning this "repo", later add its API_ACCESS_Key.
